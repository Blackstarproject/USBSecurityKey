## Phase 1: Building the Programs from Code
First, you need to compile the source code into executable (.exe) files.

Prerequisites: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed with the .NET desktop development workload.

Open the Solution: Find the solution file (e.g., UsbSecurityKey.sln) and double-click it to open the entire project in Visual Studio.

Build the Solution: In the top menu bar of Visual Studio, click Build -> Build Solution. This will compile both the UsbSecurityKey and the ProvisioningTool projects.

Locate the Files: After the build succeeds, you'll find the executable files in their respective project folders.

The key maker is at: ProvisioningTool\bin\Debug\ProvisioningTool.exe

The security guard is at: UsbSecurityKey\bin\Debug\UsbSecurityKey.exe

## Phase 2: Creating Your Key (One-Time Setup)
This phase uses the ProvisioningTool to turn your USB drive into a security key.

Insert Your USB Drive: Plug a USB flash drive that you are okay with erasing into your computer. Back up any important data from it first!

Run the Provisioning Tool: Navigate to the ProvisioningTool\bin\Debug folder and double-click ProvisioningTool.exe. A console window will appear.

Select the Drive: The tool will list all available removable drives. Type the number corresponding to your USB drive and press Enter.

Confirm Formatting: The tool will warn you that the drive will be prepared for use. Press y to confirm.

Create a Password: You'll be prompted to enter a password. This password encrypts the secret key on the drive. Type a strong password and press Enter.

Verification: The tool will automatically perform all the necessary steps: renaming the drive, generating cryptographic keys, and saving the files. When it's finished, you'll see a "SUCCESS!" message.

Your USB drive is now a provisioned security key, containing the files public.key, private.key, and password.txt.

## Phase 3: Running the Security Application
Now you can run the main application that locks your PC.

Run the Application: Navigate to the UsbSecurityKey\bin\Debug folder and double-click UsbSecurityKey.exe.

Check the System Tray: No window will open. Instead, look in your system tray (the area by the clock in the bottom-right of your screen).
You will see a new icon.

Yellow Warning Shield: This means the application is running, but your security key is not plugged in or authenticated.

Blue "i" Icon: This means your key is plugged in and successfully authenticated. Your computer is secure.

Interact with the App: You can right-click the icon to bring up a small menu. The only option is Exit, which you can use to close the 
application completely.

## Phase 4: Your New Daily Workflow 🚶‍♂️
Using the application day-to-day is incredibly simple.

When you're working: Keep the provisioned USB key plugged into your computer. The application will continuously verify it's there, 
and your computer will function normally.

When you leave your desk: Simply unplug the USB drive. Your workstation will instantly lock, preventing anyone from accessing it.

When you return: Plug the USB drive back in. Then, log into Windows using your normal password or PIN. The security application will 
automatically re-authenticate your key in the background.

### Pro Tip: Start Automatically with Windows
To avoid having to manually start the application every day, you can make it launch automatically when you log in.

Press Windows Key + R to open the Run dialog.

Type shell:startup and press Enter. This will open your personal Startup folder.

Go back to the UsbSecurityKey\bin\Debug folder.

Right-click on UsbSecurityKey.exe and select Create shortcut.

Cut or copy this new shortcut and paste it into the Startup folder you opened in step 2.

Now, the security application will start automatically every time you log into Windows.
